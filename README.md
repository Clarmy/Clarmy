Hi, I'm Clarmy, a meteorologist working in Beijing, China. I'm an open-source enthusiast, and I enjoy abstracting practical needs from my work, developing them into various Python extension packages for more people to use. My primary focus is the Python programming language.

Below are a few projects that I've recently developed and maintained, feel free to submit Issues or Pull Requests:

* [cnmaps](https://github.com/Clarmy/cnmaps): A Python extension package that smoothens the drawing of maps of China.
* [cyeva](https://github.com/caiyunapp/cyeva): A universal deterministic forecast accuracy evaluation tool package.
* [mplfonts](https://github.com/Clarmy/mplfonts): An elegant solution to the problem of Chinese fonts in matplotlib.
* [pyterrain](https://github.com/Clarmy/pyterrain): A Python extension package that simplifies the acquisition of DEM data.
* [pydingbot](https://github.com/Clarmy/pydingbot): A Python extension package that enhances the usage of DingTalk bots.
* [pymetaf](https://github.com/Clarmy/pymetaf): A Python extension package for parsing aviation METAR/TAF messages.
* [MeteoDataFormatNote](https://github.com/Clarmy/MeteoDataFormatNote): Meteorological data format notes.

If you find these projects helpful, please light up the little yellow star at the top right corner of the project page. Your support is greatly appreciated~😘
