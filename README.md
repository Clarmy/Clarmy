### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I'm Clarmy, a meteorological technician based in Beijing, China. I'm an open-source enthusiast. I enjoy identifying practical needs through my work and developing them into various Python extension packages for broader use. My primary focus is on the Python programming language.

Below are a few projects that I've recently developed and maintained, feel free to submit Issues or Pull Requests:

* [cnmaps](https://github.com/Clarmy/cnmaps): A Python extension package that smoothens the drawing of maps of China.
* [cyeva](https://github.com/caiyunapp/cyeva): A universal deterministic forecast accuracy evaluation tool package.
* [mplfonts](https://github.com/Clarmy/mplfonts): An elegant solution to the problem of Chinese fonts in matplotlib.
* [pyterrain](https://github.com/Clarmy/pyterrain): A Python extension package that simplifies the acquisition of DEM data.
* [pydingbot](https://github.com/Clarmy/pydingbot): A Python extension package that enhances the usage of DingTalk bots.
* [pymetaf](https://github.com/Clarmy/pymetaf): A Python extension package for parsing aviation METAR/TAF messages.
* [MeteoDataFormatNote](https://github.com/Clarmy/MeteoDataFormatNote): Meteorological data format notes.
